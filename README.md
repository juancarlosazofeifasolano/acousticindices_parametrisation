# Acoustic Indices Parametrisation

This repository provides a reproducible workflow for evaluating how different parameters —sampling frequency (`fs`), window size (`NFFT`), and window overlap (`Overlap`)— affect multiple acoustic index comparisons. This repository includes codefor the calculation of acoustic indices with 432 parameter iterations, the computation of non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) and derived multivariate descriptors, and the assessment of the parametrisation influence using Bayesian models. In addition, we include code for a dashboard to visualize the influence of parametrisation on the nMDS, five audio file examples for each habitat studied, and the complete acoustic index computations for the full list of audio files.
We present examples from  both **terrestrial** and **underwater** soundscapes.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juancarlosazofeifasolano/acousticindices_parametrisation.git
```

### 2. Run MATLAB Scripts

For computing the the acoustic indices (H, ACI, AEI, ADI, NDSI) with the 432 unique iterations:
- Navigate to `code_matlab_acousticindices/`
- Use MATLAB Desktop or for computing acoustic indices
- Results are saved automatically under `outcome_acousticindices/`

> ✅ All MATLAB scripts are set up to:
> - Use relative paths for seamless portability

### 3. Run R Scripts

For computing the ordination analyses and Bayesian models. Results from the full list of audio files are already included in the folders:
- Multivariate analyses: located in `code_r_multivariate/`
- Bayesian GLMMs (via `brms`): located in `code_r_glmm/`

> ✅ All R scripts are set up to:
> - Use relative paths** for seamless portability
> - Automatically check and install any missing R packages
